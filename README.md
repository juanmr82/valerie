# Asking a Date to Valerie (I am not really a FE Developer Edition)

## Requirements

Install Flask using pip (Recommended using Virtual Environments)
```console 
pip insall Flask
```

Install Requests using pip Recommended using Virtual Environments) 
```console 
pip insall requests
```

## Usage

Run app.py using your IDE or on the console: 
```console 
python app.py
```
Navigate to 
```console 
http://localhost:5000
```
The date can be enter manually or using the date picker on the right of the input. No, you can't say "no" <br>
This was done during a short coffee break, so no, it is not the most advanced code ever,
but it has been done with passion ;-)

## Upgrades
Maybe also sending customized messages or giving date options :-)

## Donations
I accept food
