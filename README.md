# Asking a Date to Valerie (Beginner Edition)

## Requirements

To run on windows (Please tell me you have windows)

Install pywin32 using pip (Recommended using virtual environments)

## Usage
Simply Run the code on your IDE. Input the date when asked. No, you can't say "no" <br>
This was done during a short coffee break, so no, it is not the most advanced code ever,
but it has been done with passion ;-)

## Upgrades
Next tool to be released as a web app with a proper frontend and backend.
